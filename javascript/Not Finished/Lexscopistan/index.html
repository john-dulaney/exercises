<!-- Instead of processing the entirety of the resources in
bulk - which is what the stâck-skope does - this skope
will return an object that has a method for processing
each type of mineral.

We're exposing the functionality of this skope to code
in the outer scope, so that the order in which minerals
are processed can be customized.

Hëap-skopes workshops can process 5 kilograms of a
mineral with each work order. So every time the `process`
function is invoked, subtract 5 from the amount of the
requested mineral from the enclosed gemMine above. -->

<!-- 
Subtract 5 from the total kilograms available in
the gem mine, but make sure you stop when there
are no minerals left.
*/

5kg, or more, of the mineral remaining? ^^^
You can reference the `gemMine` variable here
because it lives in an outer scope:
e.g. gemMine[requestedMineral].kilograms -->
